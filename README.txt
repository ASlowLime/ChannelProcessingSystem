The required modules are NumPy, sys, unittest, and PyQt5.

NumPy can be installed by following the instructions here: https://numpy.org/install/

PyQt5 can be installed by following the instructions here: https://pypi.org/project/PyQt5/

Once these requirements are satisfied, the program can be run by running main.py, either through the command line or through an IDE.

This program includes a suite of unit tests which can be run from the util_tests.py file, either through an IDE or through the command line. To run these tests from the command line, the following command can be entered in a terminal that has been opened within the directory holding utils_test.py: python -m unittest discover -p "*_test.py"
